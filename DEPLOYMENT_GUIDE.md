# Vercel Deployment Guide

## 🚀 How to Deploy to Vercel

### Step 1: Prepare for Deployment
1. Make sure you have the latest build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Commit all changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel routing"
   git push
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Vite project
6. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
After deployment, test these URLs:
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/` (should work)
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/orders` (should work after refresh)
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/order/1` (should work after refresh)

## 🔧 Files Added for Vercel

### `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### `public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## ✅ What This Fixes

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ `/orders` page shows 404 on refresh
- ❌ `/order/1` page shows 404 on refresh
- ❌ Direct links don't work

**After Fix:**
- ✅ All routes work on refresh
- ✅ Direct links work
- ✅ Browser back/forward works
- ✅ All React Router features work

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **vercel.json** tells Vercel to redirect all routes to `index.html`
2. **React Router** then handles the client-side routing
3. **Assets** are cached for better performance

## 🔄 Redeploy After Changes

If you make changes:
1. `npm run build`
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m "Your changes"`
4. `git push`
5. Vercel automatically redeploys

Your application should now work perfectly on Vercel! 🎉
